    description: "Developed an intelligent AI solving the 2048 puzzle game using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Implemented strategic heuristics including positional weighting, clustering penalties, and empty cell analysis. Created a depth-limited search algorithm balancing computational efficiency with strategic planning. Built a full-stack application with Python/FastAPI backend and React frontend connected via Axios to visualise the AI's decision-making process in real-time. The system achieves high scores, reaching the 2048 tile at >90% rate.",

    description: "The protocol for attendance taking in NYJC during a crisis was through filling up Google forms. Threats that trigger lockdowns in schools are real, and the protocolâ€™s flaws could cause casualties in crucial moments. Convicted to change this, I gathered like-minded Computing classmates and initiated code4.ny, a project to code a web app to gather attendance during a crisis. The development process was not in our curriculum, thus we encountered issues surrounding UI plans, implementations, and database structures. Persevering through these setbacks was extremely challenging, but through it, we found new ways to adapt to new territories. Made an MVP application with a local database to present to our vice-principal.",
